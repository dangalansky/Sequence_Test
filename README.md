# Sequence_Test

My version of the popular Simon Game for web formats. A very basic application but an important test of my Javascript skills.

This project involves a basic HTML format run by Javascript code. This was my first project using JQuery. All sound samples were made by myself using GarageBand. All shapes created by myself using Adobe Illustrator. As always, feel free to steal or destroy!
